	 * @brief Loads audio and provides an ability to play them.

	 * This class is to be used in conjunction with the Source class. Currently

	 *
	 * @paragraph Usage
	 * Before use, you must call ``initialize()`` to produce the OpenAL context,
	 * otherwise a barrage of errors will be displayed in the console. Before
	 * shutdown of the game, make sure all playing Sources are stopped and you
	 * have called the ``teardown()`` method to clear any existing buffers from
	 * memory.
	 *
	 * The destructor must be called before teardown, you can do this by
	 * initializing before a scope, and tearing down after the end of the scope,
	 * while instantiating the Audio class within the closed scope.
	 *
	 * @code
	 * using namespace phx;
	 *
	 * audio::Audio::initialize();
	 *
	 * {
	 *     audio::Audio manager;
	 *     manager.loadMP3("core:song1", "Assets/Song1.mp3");
	 *     manager.loadMP3("core:song2", "Assets/Song2.mp3");
	 *
	 *     audio::Source source;
	 *     source.setAudioData(manager.getAudioData("core:song1"));
	 *     // also possible to do: manager["core:song1"]
	 *
	 *     source.enableSpatial(true);
	 *     source.setPosition({ 10.f, 0.f, 0.f });
	 *
	 *     audio::Listener* listener = manager.getListener();
	 *     listener->setGain(...);
	 *     listener->setPosition(...);
	 *
	 *     source.play();
