	 * @brief The actual game class for the Client.
	 *
	 * This is the class which actually implements the "game". The Client
	 * class is just a "runner" or an intermediary medium that runs all the
	 * ticking functions and manages all the layers, but this actually
	 * renders the voxel world and everything related to it.
	 *
	 * The other layers such as SplashScreen are not actually the game, but
	 * you know... just a SplashScreen - this is the main layer you actually
	 * interact with and play on.
	 *
	 * @see Layer
	 * @see LayerStack
